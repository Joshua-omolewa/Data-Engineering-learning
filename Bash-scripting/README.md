# Welcome to Bash Scripting Exercises 

## I worked on some simple tasks using Bash scripting


### Task 1

* Using the data.txt file, write a script that prints the details of all male gender in the file.

  You can find my solution [here](https://github.com/Joshua-omolewa/Data-Engineering-learning/blob/main/Bash-scripting/task1/task2.sh).
  
  **Please note I am using Linux**: you need to install awk using `sudo apt-get  install -y gawk` for my script to work.
  
  To run my script simply use `./task2.sh` and ensure the `data.txt` file is also present in the same directory as the script file
