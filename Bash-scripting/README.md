# Welcome to Bash Scripting Exercises 

## I worked on some simple tasks using Bash scripting

### Task 1

* Create a percentage calculator script. The script takes in two arguments, the argument to compute the percentage for, and the percentage value

  You can find my solution [here](https://github.com/Joshua-omolewa/Data-Engineering-learning/blob/main/Bash-scripting/task1/percentage_value.sh).


### Task 2

* Using the data.txt file, write a script that prints the details of all male gender in the file.

  You can find my solution [here](https://github.com/Joshua-omolewa/Data-Engineering-learning/blob/main/Bash-scripting/task2/task2.sh).
  
  **Please note I am using Linux**: you need to install awk using `sudo apt-get  install -y gawk` for my script to work.
  
  To run my script simply use `./task2.sh` and ensure the `data.txt` file is also present in the same directory as the script file. See image below for output
