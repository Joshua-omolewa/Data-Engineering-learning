# Welcome to Bash Scripting Exercises 

## I worked on some simple tasks using Bash scripting (Note: I am using Linux)

### Task 1

* Create a percentage calculator script. The script takes in two arguments, the argument to compute the percentage for, and the percentage value

  You can find my solution [here](https://github.com/Joshua-omolewa/Data-Engineering-learning/blob/main/Bash-scripting/task1/percentage_value.sh).
  
  To run my script simply use `./percentage_value.sh` a. See the image below for the output

### Task 2

* Using the data.txt file found [here](https://github.com/Joshua-omolewa/Data-Engineering-learning/blob/main/Bash-scripting/data.txt), write a script that prints the details of all male gender in the file.

  You can find my solution [here](https://github.com/Joshua-omolewa/Data-Engineering-learning/blob/main/Bash-scripting/task2/task2.sh).
  
  **Please note I am using Linux**: you need to install awk using `sudo apt-get  install -y gawk` for my script to work.
  
  To run my script simply use `./task2.sh` and ensure the `data.txt` file is also present in the same directory as the script file. See the image below for the output

### Task 3

* Print all the colors in an array. You can find the array in the `array_value.sh` script which can be found [here](https://github.com/Joshua-omolewa/Data-Engineering-learning/blob/main/Bash-scripting/task3/array_value.sh).
  
You can find my solution [here](https://github.com/Joshua-omolewa/Data-Engineering-learning/blob/main/Bash-scripting/task3/array_value_joshua.sh).

To run my script simply use `./array_value_joshua.sh`. See the image below for the output

### Task 4

* Create a script that checks the status of a traffic light. You can find the array for the traffic light in the `traffic_status.sh` script which can be found [here](https://github.com/Joshua-omolewa/Data-Engineering-learning/blob/main/Bash-scripting/task4/traffic_status.sh)
  * If the light is green it should print GO
  * If the light is yellow it should print READY
  * If the light is red it should print READY

 You can find my solution [here](https://github.com/Joshua-omolewa/Data-Engineering-learning/blob/main/Bash-scripting/task4/traffic_status_joshua.sh).

 To run my script simply use `traffic_status_joshua.sh`. See the image below for the output
